# bamazon

Storefront app with functionality for customers to buy products, managers to view products, add inventory and view total profits.

# Customer App (FOR BUYERS)
Customers view all products for sale, then choose one to purchase. Once they've entered in the product and quantity, the app will complete the purchase if there is enough inventory.

Enter "node bamazonCustomer.js" into the command line
Follow the prompts to buy products.


# Manager App (FOR STORE MANAGERS)
Managers have four options, to view products for sale, view products with low inventory, add stock to a product, and add new products to be sold.

Enter "node bamazonManager.js" into the command line
Follow the prompts to view all departments and their overhead and sales figures, view products, view low inventory products, add stock, or add products, and TAKE ACTION FROM THERE.

   * Supervisor App was skipped since my store didnt have a supervisor so i gave the sales figures to the manager to take control of.
